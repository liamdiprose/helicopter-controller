# Heli Project
Liam and Aden's assignment project files for the ENCE361 Heli Assignment.

## Milestone 1
* Generate PWM output on Connector J4-05 (PC5)
* Initialise the frequency of the PWM output to 150 Hx and the duty cycle of the PWM output to 50%
* Control the duty cycle of the PWM output using the UP and DOWN buttons on the Orbit daughter board. Each button in/dee creases the D.C. by 5% to a maximum of 95% , and miniumum of 5%. 
* The buttons should be debounced
